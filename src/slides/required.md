## Many have tried to kill JS

## JS started ugly

> JS had to "look like Java" only less so, be Java's dumb kid brother or boy-hostage sidekick.

> Plus, I had to be done in ten days or something worse than JS would have happened.

## But people loved it

> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript
